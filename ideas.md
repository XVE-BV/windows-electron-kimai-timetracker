# Ideas

## Jira Integration

- When starting time tracking on a Jira issue, automatically update the issue status to "In Progress" if it's not already

## Time Tracking UX

- Make description field editable while tracking (not disabled/readonly)
- Show "Update" button when description value is dirty (changed)
- Button sends update to save the modified time entry description
